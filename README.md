dewormr automates the monthly 2021-2022 SSGWEP data pipeline by joining, munging and cleaning surveillance, cash reward, hotline rumour, IDSR rumour, animal rumour and abate data into one data frame for analysis. dewormr then further munges and writes the dataset into separate files to refresh monthly provisional analysis report pivot tables and for NEMO input.
