dewormr automates monthly SSGWEP data pipeline by joining, munging and cleaning monthly summary surveillance, monthly summary cash reward, hotline rumours, IDSR rumours, animal rumours and abate data into one data frame for analysis. The script then processes the dataset into separate files to refresh monthly provisional analysis report pivot tables.
